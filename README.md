HASH PLATFORM
=================================================

The real threat always comes unexpectedly.

The Hash has already begun and it's impossible to stop it.

This time the virus is different, something rational.

It allowed some people to survive, made them stronger, but on one condition: you must spread the infection.

No one knows the true motives of the Hash, but its allies get the benefits of those who did not obey and disappeared in a raging epidemic.

The more you are involved in the infection â€” the more reward you get.

The last game in the history of the planet begins right now.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows
and Linux, OS X, and that unit and sanity tests are automatically run.
